  <h1>About Me!</h1>
  <p id="biography">
    My name is Dustin and I am currently learning how to code in order to try and get a job in the field. My work experience up to this point has been working aircraft avionics systems, starting out in the Navy and spending the past nine years working private aircraft manufacturing. While I do not have a bachelors degree I have multiple certifications to work aircraft electrical/avionics systems. My goal for the future would be to continue to learn how to code and work towards employment in the industry.
